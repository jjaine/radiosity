The Matlab file “radiosity_Scene9_table2_colorvideo.m” in this folder was used in calculating a moving-camera video used in the video https://youtu.be/krIVZvzlxUQ

I offer it here as a starting point for any of your own video-making Matlab routines. The file will not run here without modification as the paths and such are not set correctly.
